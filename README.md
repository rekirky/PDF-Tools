# PDF Tools
 Tools used to manipulate PDF files

Selection of tools I am making to facilitate quick changes to PDF files. 

Made using Python and conduct simple processes to help with my e-document filing.
I also made a quick bat file so I can run these from a single source quickly. 

## Tools currently working

* Join multiple files into one
* Split file into multiple ones
* Crop a file using mouse input

## To come (probably - depends on my needs)

* Page rotate (ideally per page & using left/right keys)
